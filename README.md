# ESP32MikroBus

Minimal ESP32C6 project with Mikrobus and Qwiic header 

I needed a minimal ESP32 project with MikroBus.
Since I couldn't find any, I decided to create it myself.

I also wanted to be able to solder it myself, otherwise I could have made the design more compact.
That is also the reason why there are only components on the top side.

Many thanks to the other folks that also made their design open source, which speeded up this design.
